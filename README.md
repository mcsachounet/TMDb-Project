# TMDb-Project
Get a list of movies from TMDb depending on some string parameters you will pick (language, release date, genres, popularity).

# Example
First, you will need to get a TMDb API key. You can request one after registering your account on TMDb. (it takes literally 2 minutes) https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction

After you get your Key, you are all set. If you want to watch a North Korean horror movie, but you want it relatively short, not too old, and not very trendy, here is what you can input in the Sample/Parameters.py

You can now run the Sample/Main.py (do not forget to install the requirements).

As an output, you will have a csv spreadsheet (under your csv_filepath) with all the matching movies classifying from the best to the worst rating:
