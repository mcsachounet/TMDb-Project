# TMDb-Project
Just a small piece of code in order to get a list of movies from TMDb depending on some string parameters you will pick (language, release
date, genres, popularity).

I am using the discover request from TMDb API. This is more “friendly” than the API because you do not have to input ID filters (language,
genre) but “real life  parameters”.

# Example
Here’s an example that shows how to use the code:

First, you will need to get a TMDb API key. You can request one after registering your account on TMDb. (it will takes literally 2 minutes) https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction

After you get your API Key, you are all set! If you want to watch a North Korean drama movie tonight but you want it relatively short, not too old, and not too popular, here is what you can input in the parameters.py
